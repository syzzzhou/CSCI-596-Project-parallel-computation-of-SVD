# What is SVD (Singular Value Decomposition)

Given a matrix \( A \) of size \( m \times n \), the SVD decomposes \( A \) into the product of three matrices:

\[
A = U \Sigma V^T
\]

Where:
- \( U \): An \( m \times m \) orthogonal matrix (columns are orthonormal eigenvectors of \( A A^T \))
- \( \Sigma \): An \( m \times n \) diagonal matrix containing the singular values (non-negative values sorted in decreasing order)
- \( V \): An \( n \times n \) orthogonal matrix (rows are orthonormal eigenvectors of \( A^T A \))

## Why It Is Important

SVD is essential for:
- Dimensionality reduction
- Noise filtering
- Matrix approximations

It is widely applied in data science and machine learning. Parallel SVD is crucial for handling large-scale datasets efficiently, enabling faster computation and scalability in high-dimensional applications.

## Method

Our project focuses on implementing a parallelized Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) using the **one-sided Jacobi method**.

### Core of Jacobi Method

The method transforms the symmetric matrix \( A \) into a diagonal matrix \( A' \), whose diagonal entries are the eigenvalues of \( A A^T \), using a sequence of rotations.

The rotation matrix \( G(i, j, \theta) \) is defined as:

This rotational matrix operates only on the \( i \)-th and \( j \)-th rows/columns to make them orthogonal to each other. Sequentially, we can make all the columns orthogonal to each other. In this way, we would be able to retrieve U* Î£ , and our final rotational matrix would be V.

### Parallelization Strategy

The independence of Jacobi rotations makes the method highly amenable to parallel computation. Each rotation involves only two columns, and different column pairs can be processed simultaneously.

### Tools:
- **OpenMP**
- **MPI**
- **CUDA**
- **Hybrid Parallelization**

By benchmarking each parallelization approach and their hybrid implementation, the project provides insights into the efficiency of these methods for large-scale SVD computations.
